This mod aims to expand Tonauac's blessings in a vanilla-friendly way.
How it works is simple. Tonauac is a devout believer, Tonauac also understands the notion that klux is a god that values equiviant exchange. Tanauac also loooooooves food.
Therefore, give Tonauac 1 parcel of food, get the benefits from that food. Give tonauac 9 parcels of the same food, get the benefits of that food that lasts 9x as long.

In mathematical terms:

Eating 1 banana split gives you<br>
428 seconds of run boost<br>
428 seconds of % max energy boost

Giving tonauac 9 banana splits gives you a bonus of:<br>
428 x 9 = 3852 seconds of run boost<br>
428 x 9 = 3852 seconds of % max energy boost<br>

(approx. 1hr, which is about the same as a vanilla blessing's duration)<br>
(benefits capped at 24 hours)<br>


How to use:<br>
1. Go visit Tonauac at the outpost<br>
2. Place the food you want to donate to Kluex inside of the Small Container right behind Tonauac<br>
3. Talk to Tonauac to recieve his vanilla blessing + all effects from the given food with a cumulative duration for each effect<br>
   -All provided items inside of the sacrificial container are consumed (So for your sake, don't place anything you arn't willing to sacrifice into the container).

Since this script only runs from the outpost (a single-player only instance), this mod is vanilla friendly.<br>
However, you may need to be in single player or have the mod installed on the server itself. This shouldn't be an issue for vanilla-only servers as player buffs can be retained between single player and mutlplayer sessions.

FAQ:

Q: Is this compatible with Food Stack?<br>
This is compatible with Food Stack, but I do not calculate more than 24hrs worth of food, so only give Tonauac 24hrs worth of food, else he will greedily consume the rest.

Q: Does this mod work with [insert food name here] food?<br>
This will work with all modded and vanilla food. Active effects on the player characters that are provided by food may be limited to the universe the character is in. That is, suddenly xfering a modded character to a vanilla server may have any non-vanilla food effects removed. This is due to non-vanilla food benefits trying to work with a vanilla server, and has nothing to do with this mod.


Let me know of any bugs and/or problems that may arise and, as always, may Kluex guide your path!
